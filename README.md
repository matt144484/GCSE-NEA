# GCSE-NEA
This is my GCSE Computing NEA. It is a dice game between 2 players, in which they each roll two dice 5 times and their score is calculated each turn based on an algorithm, which adds or takes away from the value on the dice depending on whether each one is odd or even.
There is three files;

- main.py, which calls and executes all the subroutines.
- subroutines.py, which contains the majority of the projects code in various subroutines
- winners.txt, which contains the names of all the past winners and their scores
